# Time Series Forecasting Energy Usage
Exploring time based predictions using a dataset of multiple energy companies.

## Lessons Learned
Learned about extracting features from a Datetime object for time forecasting
Learned and used more plotting
Used XGB Regressor
Even though I thought month would be important, the day of the year is very related and was a better indicator for the prediction.
