# Time Series Forecasting Energy Usage
Exploring time based predictions using a dataset of multiple energy companies.

## Lessons Learned
1. Learned about extracting features from a Datetime object for time forecasting.
2. Learned and used more plotting.
3. Even though I thought month would be important, the day of the year is very related and was a better indicator for the prediction.
